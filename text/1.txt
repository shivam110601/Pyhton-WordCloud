Yeh karein mujhe hate
But I’m used to it
Money’s all I make and
I’m used to it
Yeh lage mujhe fake
But I’m used to it
I do it one take
‘Coz I’m used to it
Blowing up mere paas nahi hai waqt na
Baatein karne ko I don’t like to talk that much
Going up neeche aaunga ni ab aan
Jo bolte the zyada unki bolti hai band
Dollar sign kare drop that’s another one
Naya din naye opps just another one
On the beat laaya heat, watch the summer come
Saath huyi shamil woh na tamil but she vanakkam
Hey yeh samajh nahi paa rahe mera game plan
Mile cheques mile neck jaise hang man
Apne dost rakho close tu na gang man
8 figures se bhi trigger finger meri bechain
Level mera baahar kare par tere reach ke
Sath ya khilaaf karte baat na hum beech mein
Bane yahan nawab jo gawar aur galeech se
Album inki biki-ni and ain’t taking beach wear
Seedha seedha maine bola sach
Peele tola dus phir bhi nahi hoga buzz
Iss game mein tu joke beta hass thoda
See my money coming long tera hasbulla
Raaste hain dekhe maine
Faasle hain dekhe maine
Bohat se hain dekhe maine yoon
Kabhi paas to na the yeh mere
Khaas to na the yeh mere
Vaaste hain tere mere kyun?
Kaise inke tareeke bane bakre yeh bali ke
Saare kate hain gali maine ratte hain tareeke
Bane rakhe khali yeh andar se khaali pateele
Nawabi inki hate na ghate na inki phati mein
Dikhe farzi saari inki galti
Jab ho meri marzi hai faadi inki parchi
Dekhe mujhe haters dete gaali and they curse me
Jab aage laga lagon only time I want mercy (Murcie)
Main hoon woh jisne baat nahi maani
Main hoon woh jisne kabhi haar nahi maani
Main hoon woh jiski sunte baad mein kahaani
Main hoon woh jisko tum yaad karo jaani
Main hoon woh
Bolein all this bolein all that
Uthata nahi main phone
Aur main karta nahi hoon call back
Ban’na chahte mere dost kar tu fall back
Hit kare shift when they rap ‘coz it’s all cap
Mujhse pade feeke number inke neeche jaa rahe
Koi sense nahi bana rahe laga peeke aa rahe
Rozgaar de raha inko lage GKRA
Inke hardest bars hain woh jo mere weakest waale
No beast mode brodie I’m on demon time
Yeh to khud golibaaz they don’t need A9
Dikhe inhein success they don’t see the grind
Agar kare test, me taiyyar I don’t need a sign
Bloing up karun stop nahi
Inko laga mujhpe lenge shot lage lottery
Par saare huye flop, dhoondhe job, laga naukri
Leave you crossed out jaise maare baithe chaukdi
Chahiye inhein beef to phir beef lo
Agar chahiye tujhe peace, then just keep low
But I heard that your girl is a freak though
Roz London pe kare land jaise Heathrow
Now KR$NA getting wavy
You might catch a wave jaise navy
Poochi are you single, I said maybe
You can Holla when you pull up to my area, c’mon
Party pehli hai pant Prada ki pehni hai
Tu pehle se pu*sy maine pehle p*la tha pehli mein
Lage jelly yeh phati padi to pehle hi hai
Pehle peeta hoon perigon paani ki jagah perrier
The way I did scheme
You can tell me I’m pushing P
Keep pushing me agar chahiye dushmani
Karne laga hustle aaj tak hai ruki nahi
Agar budget hoga bada only way they booking me
‘Coz I’m
Mai asli me asli hoon, no cap
Beaton pe jungli hoon, no cap
Dheet hoon mai sanki hoon, no cap
Karta mai mann ki hoon, no cap (Praaaaah)
Mai asli me asli hoon, no cap
Beaton pe jungli hoon, no cap
Dheet hoon mai sanki hoon, no cap
Karta mai mann ki hoon, no cap (Yeah)
Aaj kal yahan boht se jan
Bhaunke milte hi occasion, ayy
No time, i got no patience
Tujhe chahiye jung, bhej apni location, ayy
Mere gaane on rotation
Ye soch se gareeb, dedo donation, ayy
Desi, hoon mai south asian
Par skin colour lage jaise caucasian, ayy
No money, no conversation
Mai toh unavailable, hamesha on vacation (Ayy)
Headshot agar confrontation
Inki topi bhi uda doon lage convocation (Ayy)
Back with it, practising
Attack karoo mai facts leke
Jaise activist, accurate (Accurate)
Ravaging wrap in immaculate packaging
Karna calculate meri value hai challenging (Krrrr)
Mai maharathi, lagoo Narad hi
Bharti bhasha me bars lage inke maha raddi
Karoo flow jaise maha nadi Parvati
Sarathy- ab kinare pe utaaro meri aarti (Jai!)
Mai often akela, no orphan
Aur ghoomta nahi leke mai saath me boht jan (Bhot jan)
Ye rappers youtube pe hai hit
Par shows pe they don't sell tix jaise boston (Haa!)
Instagram pe aake karenge bhot baat
Asli me jhaat barabar nahi inki aukaat (Naa!)
Makasam, chod daala pura career
Diya hai inhe burial, R.I.P to your whole squad (Yeah)
Inki beef thi mazak then they sent me
Trigger dabaoo and i squeeze till it's empty (Brrrr, fa)
Mere numbers huye double, kare envy
Now i be living up in their mind - wo bhi rent-free
Mujhe dhamki na jamti hai, no cap
Tere favourite rapper ka mere jaisa na vocab (No)
Body bag me daloo, lagega toe tag
Ghodi bhi bana doon lagoge shakal se bojack (Ha!)
Surgery, gaano pe kara hai maine murder hi
All these industry plants, it's feeling like a nursery
Verbally lete mera style kare burglary, perjury
Soche i'll get plaid jaise burberry
Mera impact rap pe hai in fact
Slay when I swing that, wave me mai sinbad (Damn!)
Big facts jab mai spit karoo syntax
Real n I been that, rule-hai-ye - spin that (Wooo)
Bring that, khol champagne bro
Aur poster lagenge jaise campaign ho (Yeah)
Ye dost ab banenge, bana fanpage bro
Aur post ab karenge jaake 'gram pe roz (Prrrraaaah)
Hasta la vista, na wasta na rishta
Khaas tha na last gaana, paas tha na KR$NA
Saanp zyaada - ghaans kaat aa, raasta na dikhta
Khaata na naashta na pasta na pizza (No)
Eat emcees, my pen breeds some envy
F in the chat, N I don't mean friendly
Your girl be dreaming of semen, while she be scheming
Word to Talha & Demon, might pull up on you like agency
Funny how they poke me, lame bhot hi (Bhot)
Thinking that they'll smoke me, aim closely (Close)
Running with some pussies like your name Josie
Ye rappers lage sugar, no Shane Mosley (Brrraaa)
Haan, itne bars, toh baar baar lage felony
Scope leke baitha bata kaun yahan Kennedy?
Boht saare beta mere sworn yahan enemies
Highway pe karoo cruise, Tom ya Penelope
14 saal meri umar thi (Haan)
Pta chala meri likhai me hunar thi (Haan)
Itni baar mere sapno ko kuchal diya
Par gaano se jalai mene kuch arthiyan
Hustle kiya, maine kaam nahi roka
Mujhe kitno ne bola tera kaam nhi hoga
Oar aaj, aisa koi naam nhi hoga Jisne suna mera kaam aur salam nhi thoka
Laaya bars me toh kabhi dara nhi beef se
Kabhi bhaga nahi kabhi hatta ni peeche
Ye bole ye layenge gang Mai bollon bhai lan'do jaise enrique Sunni mene bhi logo ki bakwaas Hai
Wo jo kare 10 baat par kabhi na sach baat
Jaata tha mai school leke bus pass
Ab jhaz me bethoon kabhi kabhi first class
Jazbaat rakhe kabu me (Haan)
Jab mere gaane chalae ni Dj waale babu ne (Haan)
Gurgawan katta baju me (Haan)
Choore samajh na aave tane maroon me kya?
Underground jaise jahanam hai (Haan)
Mene de di inhe maut jaise kanoon hai (Haan)
Aur kari mene mehnat kari mene grind
Ab Kr $ tujhe maloom hai na
Pareshani hui inhe mujhe dekhke
Socha nhi itne log bhi yahan fake the
Ab dekh ke karenge mujhe hate ye ,Par deta nahi fuck
Jaise Bandi pehle Date pe
Headstrong, mera Will Nhi Tora
Mene Chilame jalai, Koi Mila Nhi Bhola
KR$NA Kabhi Kill Nhi Hoga
I am Married to the Game, Uska Dil nhi Toda
I swear, Me Gheri Neend Nahi Soya
Mene rakha Vishwas, apna Deen Nahi Khoya (I SWEAR)
Inhe Chahiye uss Ped ka Fal
Jis Ped Ka Salon ne Kabhi Beej nhi Boya (I SWEAR)
Suna Mene, Mujh se ye Waar Chahte
Baat kar Lodu, Kabhi ghar se yu bhaar aake
Inki jali, Banna paye Parivaar waale
Sunhere rang ke, Jalpari Baal Waale
Meri Taraf bhej Sub tu, Barbad Karoon Tera sub me
Me koi ladka ni Halka, Me ladka ni Kal ka
Me ladka jo Pada Bhaari 12 Varsh se
Dekho Dekho Dekho Bhaage dar se
Dekho Dekho Dekho Aankhe Tarse
Jub 2009 me, Kara Tha club Show me
Tub to batao bhai app kidhar the?
Me Hi Wo Jissne sub jala dala
Kabrastaan Me tera Maqbara dala
Rapping Ka Tune Haq gava dala
Mene Hindustaan Me Firse Buzz Bana Dala
Hip-hop me ara Tha,Bhag Bhaga Dala
Hip-hop me ara Tha,Bhag Bhaga Dala
Hip-hop me ara Tha,Bhag Bhaga Dala
Youtube ko mene Pornhub bana Dala
Dekh kaun? aaya wapas ab
Chor de Kalam, kar na Zaaya Kagaz ab
Mere jaisa ban paya gayaak , jal-laya fire
Jaise laya riot (ab)
Why ya quit? Talk a Little bit More
I am from the land of the millitant war
South London raise, I am killer with bars
But you are missing the point
Like the pyramids are,( no cap)
Bakchodi kare, kabhi na rap kare
Jinki ego itni badi, follow back na kare
Backstab kare, kabhi tag na kare
Isliye inke sath saiyaan dab na kare
Laaya main fire jaise Shabana Azmi
Isliye gaane sunke jale saare aadmi
Krsna tha yahan beta tumse pehle
Aur Krsna hoga yahan tumhare baad bhi
Yeah
Dollar Sign, One time
14 years of age, realised my writing was strong
They crushed my dreams but i lit their pyre with songs
I hustled, never stopped, even though they told me that i would be a flop
But today, shit changed, there isn't a name in the game that doesn't gives me props
I got bars, I always went the beef way
Never ran away, never been a cheap skate
They say they'll get the gang
I tell 'em Bhai lan'do(bring 'em) just like Enrique\
Heard a lot of nonsense
But never heard what's right
Used to take the bus to school
Now i sit first class in a flight
Didn't feel bad when the DJ didn't play my shit
In Gurgaon we keep guns
If you don't get it, I might have to spray that shit
I'm Underground like the depths of hell
Gave them death like I'm the law itself
Worked hard on my grind
Now KR dollar sign, you know it well
They jealous seeing me do great
Didn't realise people were so fake
Now they hate, but i don't give a fuck like girls on the first date
Headstrong, couldn't break my will apart
They couldn't kill me or kill my art
Smoked weed but lost hope for god
I'm married to the game, I never broke her heart
(I swear) I don't sleep too sound
I kept my belief and never let mine down (I swear)
They always want the fruit of the tree, that they didn't even plant in the ground (I swear)
Heard they want war with me
Bitch get out the house and come talk to me
They jealous, it's a family affair
The one with the Golden coloured mermaid hair
Send a sub towards me, I'll destroy everything you seek
I'm not new to this game, boy i'm 12 years deep
Look at them run and hide
Look at the tears in their eyes
Tell me where were you when I was rocking clubs in two thousand and nine?
I'm the one who brought the flames
I'm the one that put you in your grave
Lost the right to call yourself a rapper
Ever since I gave India the real taste
Tryna be Hip Hop, I got you all torn up
Tryna be Hip Hop, I got you all torn up
Tryna be Hip Hop, I got you all torn up
It's like my songs turned YouTube into PornHub
Look who's back again
Don't waste paper, just leave your pen
You couldn't be an artist like me
I set fire like a riot in the end
Why ya quiet? talk a little bit more
I'm from the land of the militant war
South London raised, I'm a killer with bars
But you're missing the point like the pyramids are (No cap)
Talk shit but they never rap
Got big ego's so they don't follow back
Only back-stab but they never tag
That's why they failed after dab
Got fire like Shabana Azmi
That's why they burn like bastards do
KR$NA was here before you
And KR$NA will be here after you
Poori life main to underdog tha
Kalam chale mera lage thunderstorm sa
Beat baje jab bom pa pum pa pum pum
Saare dekhenge jalwa bhi mere dum ka
Lagi lanka shanka hai inmein
Mere bina game trash
Ab to jamta nahi bin K
Jo bhi net pe baithe gyan chodte
Unki gaand tode
Pehchan chhote hua ghanta nahi inse
Say my name say my name ya
Desi rap ko bana diya hai maine wrestlemania
Game mein baant rahe the friendship band
Phir aaya mai click click bang
Ab saare bole damn what is this behaviour ?
Bhagwan wale kaam kaise karengi yeh deviyan
Japo naam pranaam karo mai saviour
Rap maidaan thoko salaam me brigadier
Pehle bole peace phir dalenge tu subliminal
KR$NA is on the pinnacle chhodunga inhein critical
Naam bhi lage mythical
Umbilical cord pe mic ka jack karun main rap
Booth mein lagun main smooth criminal
Too clinical through syllables
Yeh to saare haare aur hua main bruise minimal
Nikalun jaloos Belarus se door Senegal
Dakaar maarun kha ke yeh rapper hai too edible
Sunta hoon sab to tu banana na mistake
Aane wali peedhi bhi sunegi mere kisse
Jo bhi bole mere gaane chale saare diss se
Woh khud chale ban’ne reality show ke hisse
That’s a fact ab karo deny
Haan school of hard knocks ka main alumni
Yeh ladkiyon ke chakkar mein sallu ban jaye
Main karun erase ex jaise saluchan guy
Sneak diss karne mujhe lage lame joke
Pichhwade mein ghusa le apna fame bro
Bars ki hai baarish beta laga le tu raincoat
Yahan to tog badalte hain rang jaise rainbow
Down in G town karun sair is shehar mein
Saare shabd yahan lipte pade hain zehar mein
Your honey be with me ungli daali rakhi shehad mein
Winnie the Pooh rappers inhen kar na paata bear mai
Inse pehle hum paisa kama rahe the
Kiya tha hustle aur game ko sambhale the
Har gaane mein kha rele maarele jaarele
Aise rapper ko to hum l**d pe bitha rele
Abhi bhi hai ghamand inhein kaahe ka
Chakh lo kalam le lo aake beta zaika
Kate inke pyaaz to aayega inhein swad
Gire aansuon ki dhaar beta failega ab raita
Kya fayada kar payega nai tu
Haar jayega marwayega bhi tu
Maar khayega lad payega nai tu
Al Qaida ban payega nhi tu
Jeet loon mera flow speed of light ya
Seedha vibe diya better leave the mic ya
Redefine kiya you just need a life ya
Inka fav-hai-kaul jaise Pidilite ya
Seedha barf wale vaadiyon pahadiyon ke beech
Aaya haavi hoke mere gaaye geet jaise
Naari hoke shadiyon pe
Mere shehar mein kaafi log hain
Jinhein gaali to thokenge tumhein adios hai
Bhaari hote mere lines yeh to jaan
Mike Tyson yeh kha rahe mera kaan
Lage dyson sucker wale kaam
Agar chahiye tujhe waar to pukaar mera naam
All my life been an underdog
But when I write, feels like a thunderstorm
When the beat go BUM'PA'PUMPAPUMPUM
It gon' feel like I've brung a bomb
Set fire to the game, they gon' fear me
Tryna compare but they ain't really coming near me
Talking shit on they INSTAGRAM LIVES, they be lying
In these lines, through the grape vine, they gon' hear me
Say my names say my name, (YA)
I made देसी rap Wrestlemania
They were handing out friendship bands
Then I came in click click bang
Now they're like "Damn!, What is this behavior?"
You can pray to your lord and savior
Brigadier of this rap game
Killing whack names, while I tap dance
Right up in the grave yard (YA)
Sending me subliminals, but I am the pinnacle
Leave 'em critical, in physical pain, KR$NA is mythical
Clinical aim, shit I'll just bang the same syllables
With blood on my name
I'll remain a blamed criminal
Ain't typical, I be busting like an AK
Been dropping rappers since I was up in the 8th grade
In a room with a cheap mic and some egg crate
A vet keeping rappers in check like it's a pay day (AH)
Hear everything they be saying about me
Just don't bring me up if it ain't about me
You know how this reality go-
If you been on a reality show
Then you ain't gon' stop me
I been doing the killing, I've been in it
I been weaving a web like infinite
I'll kill 10 rappers, in about 10 minutes
I ain't fence sitting, I'm just doing what I intended, so
Sneak dissing me, they looking like a lame joke
They be talking that shit, fuck your fame bro
I make it rain metaphors, get your raincoat
People out here here changing colors like a rainbow
Out in G town, with the speakers on blaring
Ain't about the money, I really don't care then
Pussy looking at me, I tell 'em stop staring
Winnie the poo rappers, I really can't bear them
Assassin with the rhymes, I'm blasting when it's time though
Indian top 5, then you know I'm in the convo
Eyes full of fear when I'm here, you know KR$NA is-real
I be bringin' 'em war like Palestine though
Ain't hit my prime bro, fact right there
And I be up on my grind like I ain't signed yet
Straight outta ELM Street, never show the left cheek
Weak rappers in the game, thinking I'm a nightmare
Fight fair, but I don't act that cool
Look at my captions my hashtag too
I be in the booth in a hazmat suit
Make 'em drop like corona made the NASDAQ do
Sentimental rappers, be getting they pen and pad
Trying to come up with a badder response, I make em madder'
Every time I'm ahead of these rappers, they getting dead up
Getting hotter than Nevada, I'm just trying to get my bread up
Straight outta the North side
But I'ma reside right beside South Delhi
That's my barrio
Where it's homicide on the road side
No co-sign, I just load mine
Amigo then its adios
I'm a straight heavyweight on the mic son
Giving them a earful like I'm Tyson
They be doing sucker shit like a Dyson
If you want trouble, say my name and invite some
Ridin’ solo, mere saath me nahi koi hai
Jo dost ban na chahte, dagabaaz bhi to wohi hai
Baate ye paka te, jaise paas me rasoi hai
Mujhe jo bhi ladki mili, ek raat me hi khoi hai
Bachpan se hi, dekhe mene sapne hai
Kaun hai anjaan, kaun mere apne hai?
Kamre me band, likhoon dil se
Bahar nahi aaya char din se, badle nahi kapde hai
Me magan hua gaano me, saare heran hoke
Pooche kahan tha? Sawal ye mehmano ke
Manoge, mujhko jub janoge, jaanoge mere pass nahi time nahi bahano ke
I don’t, trust nobody
Agar ghaans me hai saap
Mere paas me hai lathi
Agar Pathar tera dil
Mere haath me kulhari
Jis saans me hai tareef
Us hi saans me hai gaali, issiliye
Inse baatein karneka nahi shauk mujhe
Bache kuche dost chor gaye, laga shock mujhe
Zindagi me lage jhatke, hai bahut mujhe
Tabhi bhi na har mana, tha na kabhi khauf mujhe
Itne saal, guzare mene karte ye
Lekin mere naam ke aaj bhi hote charche hai
Shayad me kisi tareef ke na layak
Shayad mujhe aaj bhi yahan dekh ke, rapper thora jalte hai
No shortcuts, kari nahi dhandli
12 saal ki mehant, na chaar din ki chandni
Ankit aur raftaar mere saath, unko pyaar
Mene grind kari zindagi bhar, sirf pichle Saal nahi
Gane ho comercial, karte crtisize ye
Wohi gali dete jinhe kehte tum bhai the
Time hota mushkil, buzdil na rehte side pe
Par apni nazar rakhte, tumhari Kamai pe
Issiliye
